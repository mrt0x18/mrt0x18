# Here I am 0x18

I've been passionate about software since I was 12 and have been constantly honing my skills. People often call me "Crazy Man" – perhaps because of my intense dedication to my work.

👨‍💻 While coding, I always have a coffee by my side and party music playing in the background. My go-to operating system has been Windows, but I'm currently exploring the realms of Linux. Hopefully, I'll get the hang of it soon! 😄

I've always been a solitary person, and it seems I might stay that way. But in the world of code, I find my crowd.

💻 Professionally, I excel in Javascript. I'm excited to share my journey and learnings here.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts and explorers in this digital universe!
